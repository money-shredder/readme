# The Money Shredder Lab Manifesto

## What is the lab?
The money shredder lab is an unofficial name for our deep learning research team.

## What is the purpose of this GitHub organization?
Unshared knowledge incurs opportunity costs. I hope to make this organization an online workspace for the team where experience can be shared, and knowledge can be democratized.

## How can we achieve the goal?
All team members have read and write access to all repositories. We encourage all members to contribute to the pages with their knowledge, to help new members and increase team productivity.

## How to incentivize contribution?
To be determined. In the beginning I will populate the pages.

## How do we judge its effectiveness?
This would require team members to engage in the pages, and discuss them in [Team Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/money-shredder/teams/shredder) for:
  * requesting new pages;
  * questions regarding pages;
  * improvement proposals of the organization; and
  * general discussions.
